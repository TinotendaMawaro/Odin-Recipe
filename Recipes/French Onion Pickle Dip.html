<p>The perfect play between flavor and texture, this duo-dip has something for everybody to love. The low and slow caramelization deepens the flavor of the onions, giving the dip an unmistakable made-from-scratch taste. Speckled with crunchy pickles, fresh dill, and golden onions, this cool and creamy dip has a hint of salty, sweet, and tangy in every bite. Best paired with ridge-cut potato chips or pretzels.</p>
